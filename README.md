##A starter kit and installation guide for front-end projects.

After downloading the file, you're going to need these too:

  1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Node.js dowload link")
  
      -To check if the correct version of Node.js is installed, run ```node -v``` in the terminal.
        
  2. Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm "NPM installation guide") 
  
      -To check if NPM is installed, run ```npm -v``` in the terminal.
      
      -To fresh intall globally, run ```npm install npm@latest -g``` in the terminal.
      
      -To install NPM to this project, ```pwd```=> ```cd``` to this project's directory and run ```npm install``` in the terminal.
      
      -This will read the package.json file collect all dependencies needed for this project. 
      
      -A node_modules folder will be created. 
      
  
  3. Install [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp "Gulp installation guide")
  
      -To install Gulp globally, run ```npm install gulp-cli -g``` in the terminal.
      
      -To use, run ```gulp``` in project's directory in the terminal, or go to the project file and type in ```cmd``` file directory then run ```gulp``` in the terminal.
      
  4. Install [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install "Sass installation guide")
  
      -To install Sass globally, run ```npm install -g sass``` in the terminal.
      
      -Remember to install a Sass extentions in your text editor. With Gulp, you won't need to "watch sass" or create a live server. Gulp will do that for you.
      
  5. Create a .gitignore file!
  
      -Visit [GitIgnore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/ "GitIgnore.io link") type in your OS (```Mac```, ```Windows```, or ```Linux```), ```Node.js```, ```Gulp```, and ```Sass```.
      
      -```Ctrl + A``` or copy all text on the page, go to text editor and ```Ctrl + N``` or create a new file, ```Ctrl + V``` or paste text into the new file, and ```Ctrl + S``` or save the file as ```.gitignore``` only.
      
      -This makes it so there are fewer changes being commited and uploaded to GitHub.
      
   6. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/ "GitHub Desktop download link")
   
      -Clone or create a new repository, commit to master, and push origin!
